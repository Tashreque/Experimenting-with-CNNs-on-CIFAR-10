# Experimenting-with-CNNs-on-CIFAR-10
In order to understand the behaviour of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the computer vision task of image classification, several different CNN architectures were implemented, trained and validated on the CIFAR-10 data set - a data set comprising of 10 different classes. In addition, a number of experiments like tweaking the shapes of the networks, introducing regularization techniques like batch normalization, dropouts and data augmentation were done. The best 3 networks achieved testing accuracies of 77.05%, 75.45% and 78.05% respectively. For comparison, transfer learning was done using pre-trained models of ResNet-18 and VGG-19, leading to testing accuracies of 94.06% and 91.77% respectively. At the end of this study, some suggestions were made to improve this study in the future.
